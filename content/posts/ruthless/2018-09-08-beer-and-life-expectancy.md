**This is a post of no analysis at all. Everything in this post is meant for fun.**

I moved to Germany a few weeks ago and one of the most astonishing things I noticed is that everyone is drinking so much. Yet the life expectance of Germany is pretty high. So I performed this "analysis" for fun.

Life expectancy vs beer consumption (L) per capita per year. Data obtained from [wikipediaList of countries by life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) and [List of countries by beer consumption per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita).

As you might be curious about the life expectancy vs the life expectancy, I also made one plot about it.
