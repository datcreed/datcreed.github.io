The minimum description length ( #MDL ) is based on the idea of compression of the data.

MDL looks for the model that compresses the data well. To compress data, we need to find the regularity in the data.

There are many versions of MDL.
- crude two-part code
- [Fisher information approximation](/cards/statistics/fia) ( # FIA )
- Normalized Maximum likelihood ( #NML )
