For models with a lot of parameters, [the goodness-of-fit](/wiki/model-selection/goodness-of-fit) is very likely to be very high. However, it is also likely to generalize bad. So we need [measure of generalizability](/wiki/model-selection/measures-of-generalizability)

Here parsinomy gives us a few advantages.
- easy to perceive
- better generalizations
