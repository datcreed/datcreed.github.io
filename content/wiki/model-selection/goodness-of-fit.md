Is the data agree with the model?
- distance between data and model predictions
- likelihood function: likelihood of observing the data if we assume the model; the results will be a set of fitting parameters.

Why don't we always use goodness-of-fit as a measure of [the goodness of a model](/wiki/model-selection/model-selection)?
- overfitting
- not intuitive

This is why we would like to balance it with [parsimony](/wiki/model-selection/parsimony-of-models) using some [measures of generalizability](/wiki/model-selection/measures-of-generalizability).
